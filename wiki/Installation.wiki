= Installation manual =
There are two ways to install plugin in Total Commander:
 * manually and
 * automatically.

= Manual installation =
 * Extract archive to the path of your choice. For example _c:\totalcmd\plugins\wdx\wdxtaglib\_.
 * Place the *libtag.dll* and *msvcrt.dll* in the totalcmd.exe folder or somewhere in the %PATH%.
 * Add *wdxtaglib.wdx* as content plugin:
  * in Total Commander follow this menu path: Configuration->Options->Plugins;
  * under _Content plugins (.WDX)_ section press *Configure* button;

  * in the new window press *Add* button;
    http://wdxtaglib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/add_plugin_dialog.png
  * in the opened dialog browse to *wdxtaglib.wdx*;
  * press OK several times. 
 * Done!

= Automatic installation =
For now it is not possible to install plugin automatically due to statical linkage with TagLib library.
